# VS LaTeX Extension - README
## Note
I created this originally for my own use as a student so I could easily compile and view LaTeX file on VS Code. However, I learned node.js and typescript very briefly in order to make this, so use this at your own risk. If there is a lot of interest in this project, I may think about extending if further. Enjoy!

## Usage
There are two ways to compile to PDF:
* Go to the command palette and type "LaTeX: Build LaTeX to PDF"
* Use the button "Build to PDF" in the status bar.
* Make use of settings.json (currently the latex binaries must be added to PATH).
Note that when you are using the command from the command palette, your active window must be the LaTeX file.

## Plans
* Add a button for enabling latexmk.
* Make support for Asymptote for use with LaTeX.
* Find a better way to open PDF files.
